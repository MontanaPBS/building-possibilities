            <p class="about-content">Our world is changing. Media is changing. Montana PBS needs to change too. Montana PBS must
                invest in new technology, new facilities, and programming to grow our audience beyond today’s weekly 250,000
                viewers. Montana PBS risks becoming obsolete if we do not shape our content for future generations. To remain an
                essential media organization, Montana PBS must grow, to focus on more local community storytelling and expand
                our reporting on statewide issues.</p>

                <p class="about-content">The new Montana PBS Public Media facility will be a civic center where Montanans can participate in statewide
                dialogue, a hub for news and journalism, a homeroom for education and childhood development, and a creative
                nucleus for treasured Montana stories. </p>

                requires space where we can grow and a facility that welcomes Montanans and reflects our commitment to excellence. A
                welcoming building will encourage the public to engage with us – in person and through technology – attract more
                donors and create a strong foundation of support well into the future. No matter where you live in Montana that
                increased support secures Montana PBS’s presence in your daily life. This inspiring public face will create a whole
                new way for Montana PBS to get the conversations started.</p>
